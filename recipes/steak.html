    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a <strong>garlic rosemary-infused butter</strong> that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>
    <p>It really doesn’t get any easier than this and you don’t need much to make a lip-smacking good steak.</p>
    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>New York Steak</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Rosemary Sprigs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li><strong></strong>Season generously</strong> – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong></strong>Preheat the pan</strong> on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li><strong></strong>Sear steaks</strong> – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li><strong></strong>Add butter and aromatics</strong> – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
        <li><strong></strong>Remove steak</strong> and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
